<h2>HomeOps Guides using Devops Tools</h2>
<b>Welcome to the inetfish.com website. </b><br />
This website is a collection of guides and tools for implementing automation and tools in the home environment. <br />
The home network and home computing environment has become more complex over the years and this creates a few opportunities as well as problems to be solved.
I call it homeops.<br /><br />

<b>This homeops project is divided into 3 main categories:</b>
<ol>
	<li><a href="/infra/">Infrastructure</a> - The supporting infrastructure to run various aspects of the homeops project
	<li><a href="/homeops/">HompeOps</a> - A Collection of tools to automate the operational activities in the home network and computing environment.
	<li><a href="/tools/">Web Tools </a> - Additional tools that I found useful to develop and can be hosted in the home ops enviornment, or used directly from this website.
</ol>

<b>Guiding principles</b>
<ol>
	<li>Automation -- Homeops project and scripts should be fully automated.
	<li>Keep it Simple -- Homeops follows standard software design and operational practices. Web design is geared towards performance and simplicity.
	<li>Low Cost/No Cost -- Aside from a desktop computer, Windows OS, and Internet connection -- there are no additional costs.
 	<li>No Advertising -- Advertisiting is forbidden.

</ol>
